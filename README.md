# Operational Research for University Timetable
Topics in Applied OR Project

In the intricate, yet dynamic environment of higher academic institutions, effective space and time management is most important in ensuring a smooth flow of education experience. This report addresses, the scheduling and allocation challenges faced by the School of Mathematics, characterised by the need to accommodate a wide range of course lectures and workshops, across various rooms, each with its own capacity constraints.
The core objective of this project is twofold: -
1)	To optimize the allocation of sessions (lecture and workshop) in alignment with student enrolment numbers and available room capacities, and;
2)	To minimize the scheduling conflicts to prevent overlaps in course timings
