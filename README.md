# Operational Research for University Timetable
Topics in Applied OR Project

In the intricate, yet dynamic environment of higher academic institutions, effective space and time management is most important in ensuring a smooth flow of education experience. This report addresses, the scheduling and allocation challenges faced by the School of Mathematics, characterised by the need to accommodate a wide range of course lectures and workshops, across various rooms, each with its own capacity constraints.

The core objective of this project is twofold: -
1)	To optimize the allocation of sessions (lecture and workshop) in alignment with student enrolment numbers and available room capacities, and;
2)	To minimize the scheduling conflicts to prevent overlaps in course timings

Efficient use of resources, in terms of both space and time, ensures that both faculties are neither underused nor overcrowded, and at the same=me time, contributes to the overall well being of students and faculty but reducing stress. The goal is to create a timetable that is not just a logical solution, but also a strategic tool that helps the objectives of the school.
